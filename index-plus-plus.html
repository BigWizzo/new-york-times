    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
        son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
        far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
        A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
        special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
        of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
        pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
        irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
        in the ocean.</p>
    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
    </p>
    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
        of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
    <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYc9YmKIO8&amp;feature=youtu.be">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the
        South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
        Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the
        signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
        trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

    <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
        whether it could ever be proved.</p>
    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
        discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
        realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
        with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
        extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an
        endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
        over. </p>
    <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
        Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
        Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
